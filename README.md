# IE 692: Advanced Process Mining Project

## General information

### University of Mannheim

### Chair of Process Analytics

**Lecturer:** Prof. Dr. Han van der Aa

**Tutors:** Alexander Kraus and Adrian Rebmann

**Goal:** Our group selects a recent paper on process mining and tries to replicate the reported evaluation results with the intent to gain further insights into the results.

## Tasks

1. **Paper selection:** Selection of a recent paper on process mining for the replication study.
2. **Replication:** Obtaining data, trying to replicate evaluation results, analyzing and comparing results with evaluation results reported in the paper.
3. **Additional investigation**: This depends on the replication success itself.
- Replication failed: Find out about differences in the implementation from both sides. Is there more room for improvement?
- Replication successful: Multiple  investigation options such as check implementation for additional data or inspect the generated results in more detail.
